Save the code: Copy the Python code into a file named, for example, time_converter.py.

Run the program: Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and run it using Python: python time_converter.py

Enter details: The program will prompt you to enter the hours (0-23) and minutes (0-59) separately.

View result: It will then display the converted time in 12-hour AM/PM format.
